## Installation

### Quick Setup (Easiest Way)

I've included some setup scripts to make things easier:

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

**Windows Command Prompt:**
```batch
setup.bat
```

These scripts will check if you have Node.js, install everything, run the tests, and tell you what to do next.

**Quick note:** If PowerShell gives you an execution policy error, just run this first:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Manual Setup (If You Prefer)

1. **Get Node.js installed** (if you don't have it already)
   - Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) - grab the LTS version
   - Make sure it worked: `node --version` and `npm --version` should show versions

2. **Clone and navigate**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd kanban-board
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start it up**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Or if you want to use the scripts I made:
   ```powershell
   .\start-dev.ps1
   ```
   ```batch
   start-dev.bat
   ```

5. **Open it in your browser**
   Usually `http://localhost:5173` - Vite will tell you the exact port in the terminal

## Available Scripts

The usual npm scripts:
- `npm run dev` - Start the dev server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally
- `npm run test` - Run the unit tests
- `npm run lint` - Check code with ESLint

The idea is that `components/` has the reusable stuff that doesn't know anything about boards or tasks, and `features/board/` has everything that's specific to the board functionality. If I needed to add auth or settings later, I'd just add `features/auth/` or `features/settings/`.

## Design Decisions

Here's why I chose what I chose - I thought about this quite a bit since the prompt mentioned they'd be looking at technical decisions.

### Why Zustand over Redux?
Honestly, Redux would have been overkill for this project. Zustand gives me all the state management I need with way less boilerplate - we're talking ~1KB vs Redux's ~10KB+. The TypeScript support is great, and since this was a 6-hour project, I wanted something I could set up quickly without sacrificing quality.

### Why @hello-pangea/dnd?
react-beautiful-dnd was the go-to library for drag and drop, but it's not maintained anymore. This is the active fork that keeps it going, plus it has good accessibility features built in. The API is clean and it works well with React hooks.

### Why Vite over Create React App?
Vite is just faster - both for dev server startup and hot module reload. Create React App feels outdated at this point. Vite uses native ESM which modern browsers support, and the error messages are actually helpful. Less config, more working.

### Why Tailwind CSS?
I can build UIs really fast with Tailwind without writing custom CSS files. It purges unused styles automatically so the bundle stays small, and having styles live right in the component makes it easier to see what's going on. Plus it gives me a consistent design system out of the box.

### State Management Architecture

I put everything in a single Zustand store (`useBoardStore`). It keeps track of:
- All the lists and their tasks
- The current filter/search query
- All the actions (CRUD, sorting, moving tasks around, etc.)

I went with a single store because it's simple for this use case - no prop drilling, easy to persist to localStorage, and the data flow is super clear. If this app grew to have user accounts or settings, I'd probably split it up, but for now this works great.

### Data Persistence

Zustand has this nice `persist` middleware that automatically saves to localStorage. I configured it to only save the lists (not the filter query or UI state like "is this modal open"), so it's efficient. If localStorage fails for some reason, it just keeps going - the app won't crash.

### Component Architecture

I organized it using a feature-based structure:

- **Atomic components** (`src/components/`): Reusable UI building blocks like Button, Input, Textarea, Card - these don't know anything about tasks or boards
- **Feature modules** (`src/features/board/`): All the board-specific logic lives here
  - `KanbanBoard`: The main component that orchestrates everything
  - `ListColumn`: Handles an individual list/column
  - `TaskCard`: Shows and edits a single task

I picked this structure because it makes it really clear where everything is. If I needed to add authentication or settings later, I'd just add `src/features/auth/` or `src/features/settings/`. The atomic components can be reused across features, and testing features in isolation is straightforward.

### Testing Strategy

I focused the tests on the most critical parts:
- State management logic (all the CRUD operations, sorting, filtering)
- Custom hooks (like the filtering hook)
- Making sure the pieces work together

I didn't write component tests for the UI components because they're mostly presentational, and with the time constraint I wanted to focus on the business logic where bugs would be most costly. The store and hooks have the complex logic, so that's where I put the test coverage.

## How to Use It

Pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it:

### Creating a List
Click "+ Add List" at the top, type a name, hit Enter. Done.

### Adding a Task
In any list, click "+ Add Task", type a name (you can add a description too if you want), and hit Enter.

### Editing a Task
Click the edit icon (✏️) on any task card, change what you need, then Save. Press Escape to cancel.

### Moving Tasks Around
Just drag and drop them! You can move tasks between lists or reorder them within the same list. It works with keyboard navigation too if that's your thing.

### Filtering
Type something in the search box at the top and it'll filter all tasks across all lists by name or description. Clear it to see everything again.

### Sorting
Each list has a sort dropdown in its header. You can sort by name, creation date, or last updated. Or turn sorting off entirely.

### Deleting Things
Click the trash icon (🗑️) - tasks have it on the card, lists have it in the header. It'll ask for confirmation so you don't accidentally delete something.
